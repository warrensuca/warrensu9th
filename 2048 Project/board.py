class Board:
    '''
    A generic 2D game board of a given dimension.
    At each square in the game board, a piece can be placed onto the board
    The piece can be ANY type of item - strings, numbers, new GamePiece types...
    The board is initialized to None at the very beginning

        rsize (int): row size
        csize (int): col size
